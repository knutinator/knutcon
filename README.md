### Visual Design

- __Fonts__
    - The fonts used, <em>Roboto Condensed</em> and <em>Source Sans Pro</em> for headlines and body text respectively, were chosen for their high legibility and 'robust' characteristic. 
    - In the logo and slogan on the Home page, the font is also using a very short line-height. This gives the lettering an appearance of building-blocks, furthering the design themes of 'building' and 'creativity'.
- __Colors__
    - The color scheme is intentially minimal to keep an expression of simplicity. A single dark brown accent colour, which was picked to harmonize with the images, is used to emphasize certain important elements, such as buttons. 
- __Images__
    - The images are chosen to enhance the company's visual identity as both 'creative' and 'skillful', in order to gain the trust of the user.
